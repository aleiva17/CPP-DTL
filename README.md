<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Simple as:
1. Clone the repo.
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/aleiva17/CPP-DTL.git
  ```
2. Start using the data structures and algorithms you want. For example:
  ```cpp
  #include "vector.hpp"
  #include <iostream>

  int main() {
    dby::vector<int> nums = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

    for (int num : nums) {
      std::cout << num << ' ';
    }

    return 0;
  }
  ```
